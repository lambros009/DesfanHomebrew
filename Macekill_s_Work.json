These geodes are notoriously expensive in the material plane as their retrieval is something of a journey in and of itself. While that might not be the case in other planes of existence, it is one of the larger reasons why there are very few of them being sold and even fewer being made into one of the world's most advanced constructs.",
					"A Collective. While the process is similar in crafting a prismatic golem, the difficult part is drawing in many, if not all of the different elemental spirits from their respective planes of existence to fuel this magic construct with life. Perhaps it is because of this fused consciousness that the prismatic golem is able to breach the surface of sapience. While incredibly intelligent, the prismatic golem is still almost infantile in its mentality until it can mentally grow under the tutelage of its creator, which is why these creations usually take on the mannerisms and ideologies of those who own them.",
					"However, in the rare occurrence that one is either broken away from its subservient nature or defects, it will develop naturally through its environment; which isn't always the best result should one become as independent. After all, it could be intelligent, but it could be an instinctual intelligence instead of sapience.",
					"Master of the Elements. Prismatic golems are -- thanks to its rare core of all things -- masters of the elemental forces of the arcane. They are heavily resistant to most magical forces, and their polished onyx bodies have a tendency to reflect such forces back at the assailant. In the rare occurrence that the prismatic golem is forced to defend itself or its master, it does such with incredible efficiency. It will focus the most perceived threat to either unconsciousness or death, or it will focus those that can aid their allies through magic means. From its prismatic visage, it can create luminescent beams of all elemental forces, not to mention its geometric limbs, which all end in sharpened points. Hope you can run, for it is quick and more dexterous than most initially anticipate: But that is usually their last mistake."

When a tribe of gnolls are particularly well off in food, Flinds, leaders of their war bands begin to sacrifice live and dead flesh to their blackened altars for their god in the ravenous abyss: Yeenoghu, who upon seeing such wealth will choose to bestow upon their acolytes a withered, black heart. When a Flind consumes this heart, they undergo a painful transformation. Many do not survive the undertaking, but those who do become a Champion of Yeenoghu.

Humans refer to this phenomenon as \"The Umbra Exodus\", for it ushers in a grand omen of famine and war. Kingdoms may take up arms to slay a Champion, but it is usually deferred to adventuring parties on the premise that there may be great spoils to recover, in addition to being paid by the guild, or kingdom for their services.",

These Champions hope to usher in a new age for the grand lord himself. With such gifts, it is only a matter of time before a Champion has the strength to topple a kingdom. They wish to bring death, famine and disease to their enemies and such a self-fulfilling prophecy may come about; should adventurers shirk such innocuous quests when they hear word of a few wandering gnolls attacking the countryside.",

When civilization has crumbled and history of man's forefathers are but a whisper on the wind. Such prophecy comes when the six maws of Yeenoghu are born, children to the Beast of Butchery, they will herald an entrance to the material plane for their grand lord. They will become generals in his army, carving grevious wounds into the world of man and other races alike until there is nothing left.

The Vaurdres was one such monstrosity. A combination of a blue dragon (typically), Velociraptors or tyrannosaurus rex, and strange aquatic life. Usually either squid or octopus.",
					"Unique variant of Chimera. While chimera are usually three-headed creatures, the Vaurdres seems to share some features with its other combined animals, but it's a singular entity. Consisting of a dragon-like skull with horns, a bipedal Tyrannosaurus-like body with elongated, clawed forearms, a pearlescent blue-scaled body, eel-like tail, webbed digits and wings and a number of barnacle-like protrusions across its hide that erupt with barbed tentacles boasting hooked suction cups. Vaurdres translated to the common tongue titles this creature the \"Coral Dragon\", given its brightly colored exterior and its habitat.",
					"Exotic, but deadly. The Vaurdres is known to hang around coral reefs and tropical waters, along the shallow shores of land masses or island. It feasts upon the aquatic life that lies within, and sometimes decides to walk the land and stalk the fauna roaming about. Regardless of its brightly colored hide, it's strangely able to camouflage itself by subtly shifting its scale color to the surrounding terrain. Aside from that, it is intelligent enough to speak and understand creatures, but it's most definitely garnered much of its personality from its draconic nature. It's covetous, can sometimes have a lair and is much more cunning than most think. Some variants of the Vaurdres live in swamps, sulforus springs or anything inbetween.",
					"Sea Pirates. The Vaurdres is intelligent enough to make deals with pirates and is one of the few reasons why boats are pillaged and destroyed well before they get to their destination. To make a deal with this creature requires either a silver tongue, or enough wealth to keep it placated long enough before it requires another lump sum to keep their arrangement going.",
					"It isn't uncommon for a Vaurdres to become the leader of a ring of pirates, if it has enough wealth and power to maintain it, but this rarely ever occurs. However, Vaurdres that live long enough are said to grow nearly as large as an ancient dragon. Very few of those have ever been seen.",

Some people describe it having any number of large, spiraling horns that jut outward from its cranium. From the descriptions of an adventurer who saw one, an artist has been able to give others a more in-depth view of this abomination. See to the right of this tome.",

Having been born in a similar fashion to creatures from a beholder, the Blink Walker's existence is much, much more fickle in its persistence to stay within the realms of men; or to blink out of existence should the god's dreams shift like the ever moving tide. The Blink Walker knows its days are numbered, but few have figured the method of extending their lives; which adventurers find disadvantageous. You see, the way the Blink Walker extends its life is by consuming and assimilating memories from creatures that are more...permanent, extending that same permanence onto the Blink Walker for a time. (Ie. When a creature fails the Maddening Gaze & Whisper ability saving throw. Shown in the statblock.)",
					"When Blink Walkers die, it's ironic that in their death, they rapidly create life themselves that is evermore permanent than they could ever be; even thriving in the most inhospitible of places. Massive lavender Weeping Willows that extend from their corpses and grow for untold centuries. Tendril-like branches extending outwards in strange, alien patterns that give the exotic gem-like tangles of leaves a more unique beauty. Strangely enough, the fruit it bears (which looks terrifying like its head, albeit much smaller) is rumored to have strange ethereal properties when eaten raw and when processed correctly, can even be used to help recall memories that have been locked away, consumed by the Blink Walker, or have been magically sealed or removed (Including the magics of the Feywild that causes one to forget when left).",
					"To those who freely give their sins",
					"Although uncommon, the Blink Walker is sometimes known to even make deals with creatures native to certain planes of existence, consuming unwanted memories for a fraction of its power. With more memories consumed, certain Blink Walkers gain permanence for the rest of their days and even finding time to form a personality and grow as a creature as time continues. What the Blink Walker doesn't know, is that while it might never age and live untold centuries, it's appetite for memories grows with the decades, forcing them to continue making pacts with creatures to satiate its need for survival. These Blink Walkers are very rare indeed, and most who have grown so old are usually named members of their strange race.",
					"Creatures who so freely give their memories are bestowed more and more power with each memory given, and while pacts passively increase both the Elder Blink Walker and the contractee, it is only ever a dangerous gamble. After all, the Blink Walker is a selfish creature that would rather satiate its hunger than truly aid those of its pact.",
					"When a Elder Blink Walker reaches the peak of its evolution through assimilating memories its consumed, it finds that consuming the consistent amount currently does little to fill its metaphorical stomach. So? Like any irrational creature, it begins to gorge itself on stored memories, or even actively stealing them for creatures within or around its lair.",
					"This Phenomenon (The Great Elusion) usually tells experienced adventurers and veteran's alike that a powerful Blink Walker has make its stake in the material plane. As one will likely find great swathes of creatures in all cities and towns alike remembering less and less as memories are stolen from them in a desperate attempt to keep the Elder Blink Walker alive.",
					"Now, some older Blink Walkers are intelligent enough to realize this small flaw decades before it happens, actively eating the bare minimum to keep itself both semi-full and stable within its own existence. These Blink Walkers have the potential to become even more powerful than Elder Blink Walkers and are usually the most cunning. It takes stronger adventurers to even find these particular aberrants and even stronger individuals to fell it."

In doing so, some Elders will begin to build themselves a lair, however, unlike creatures native to the plane it resides, it can move its lair with enough time and psionic power.

The Shocking Zombie Brute is as deadly as it is a spectacle.

These monstrosities - amalgamation of humanoids and creatures alike, are the child of eccentric and sometimes forbidden magic that delves into what the arcane can truly do. While mages of all kinds did such things during the age of arcanum; much has changed since then, and many steps have been taken to not fall down the same path. Regardless, some might not head these words and tamper with the weave. The result of such a thing is The Choir and its many variants.",

After all, to be fused and connected with all those it assimilates in its path is pain unending; but in the hazy fog of its existence, the fragment of intelligence it wields hopes to lessen the burden with more souls. It is a shame that it doesn't know it is only making its existence even worse, as all those assimilated are still living. However, in the hive mind of this creature, they cannot escape and are forced to watch as innocent lives are added to the pile to experience the same agony.",

Although it is reported that those who have heard it, describe it as haunting, as every living thing fused to it speaks as one. They even stated how it knew things about them no one should have known. A troubling notion. Nonetheless, there is a rumor of a way to either free those assimilated, or at least lay them to rest. Strangely, the adventurer said it called for a song that was pure and came form the depths of ones heart.",

Based off the size of an Orchestra, the String represents the number of humanoids fused (being 12-21 usually) into one being. While these are the most common of the variants spotted, they're no less dangerous than the larger varieties.",
					"The most dangerous thing about the Choir String is its voice. Given its slow movement, most adventurers can easily kite these creatures and take them down from afar, but its truly their song that is dangerous. For if it worms its way into your head, you'll find yourself willingly approaching it and listening to it until your die, or are knocked unconscious and added to the mix. Choir Chambers are created when Choir Strings assimilated enough humanoids to fit the requirements of an actual Orchestra Chamber."
